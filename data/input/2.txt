It should allow customers to create and manage their accounts, view available products, and place orders easily through an intuitive interface. The system must support secure transactions and maintain user data confidentiality at all times. It should also enable administrators and sellers to manage product listings, track orders, and monitor inventory levels effectively. The application should perform all operations smoothly and respond quickly to user actions, ensuring a positive user experience. Furthermore, the system should be designed to handle multiple users and transactions simultaneously without performance degradation. It must be adaptable to future updates or additional features, such as promotional offers or new payment options. Overall, the e-commerce system should simplify the buying and selling process, minimize manual effort, and ensure reliability, accuracy, and scalability to meet the growing demands of users and the market.
