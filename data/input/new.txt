We want to build a web-based system that helps us manage student data more efficiently. Currently, we’re keeping records manually, which is slow and often causes mistakes. The new system should allow us to register new students, keep track of their attendance, grades, and personal details, and generate performance reports whenever needed. Teachers should be able to log in and update student information, while students should have access to view their results and attendance. We’d also like to have an admin dashboard to monitor all activities and make updates when required. It would be great if the system could send notifications or emails to students about important announcements. The interface should be clean, responsive, and easy to use, even for people who are not very tech-savvy.
