Chapter 1:
Introduction:
The purpose of this project proposal document is to outline the development of an
advanced stock price forecasting system made to specifically take into account the
unique characteristics of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). Conventional forecasting
methods mostly base their projections on historical price trends. Therefore,, these
techniques frequently fail to take into consideration abrupt changes in the market
environment and the non-linear linkages that control fluctuations in stock prices. This
project aims to improve upon these traditional techniques by incorporating both
traditional statistical techniques and modern machine learning techniques. The primary
focus is on improving stock price predictions by taking into account not only the
historical stock prices but also sentiment analysis and macro-economic indicators. [5]
The PSX market is influenced by a wide range of factors such as political
developments, economic conditions and market sentiments. Traditional time-series
forecasting methods like ARIMA often struggle to account for abrupt market changes
and non-linear factors. This limitation is highlighted even more in PSX as it is a highly
volatile market that is heavily influenced by external factors. The proposed system
addresses these challenges by incorporating state-of-the-art machine learning
techniques like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with traditional statistical models like
ARIMA or Bayesian Structural Time-Series (BST). Moreover, sentiment analysis from
social media and news sources as well as macro-economic factors like Gold and Oil
prices are also incorporated to increase the prediction accuracy further.

Problem Statement:
PSX is a highly unpredictable market and projections have a big impact on investing
strategies. Stock price forecasting has long been a major field of research because
there are so many intricately interacting variables that affect the market, such as
political developments, investor mood and economic indicators which makes accurately
predicting stock prices extremely difficult. Conventional forecasting methods, such
ARIMA and Bayesian time series models, mostly base their projections on past price
trends because of which these techniques fail to take into consideration abrupt changes
in the market environment and the non-linear linkages that control fluctuations in stock

prices. This difficulty is made much more acute in the case of the Pakistan Stock
Exchange (PSX) by the market’s susceptibility to regional political and economic
situations. The proposed system provides a solution to these difficulties by incorporating
modern machine learning techniques along with traditional statistical techniques,
macro-economic data and sentiment analysis to accurately predict stock prices. In
recent years, machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for handling complex
data patterns, allowing for more sophisticated and adaptable forecasting models. It is
feasible to extract patterns from stock market data and get deeper insights by utilizing
the capabilities of neural networks, such as RNN and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
models. These neural network models may also help identify trends that conventional
methods would overlook [1]. Furthermore, sentiment analysis may be included into
stock price prediction for increased prediction accuracy. This technique analyzes the
tone and sentiment of news articles, social media postings, and financial data to provide
useful context.

Problem Solution:
To address the challenges outlined in the problem statement, this project proposes the
development of an advanced stock price forecasting system that combines sentiment
analysis and traditional time-series forecasting methods like ARIMA or Bayesian
Structural Time-Series (BST) with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in order to
overcome the issues mentioned in the problem description. The model is especially
made to forecast stock prices on the Pakistan Stock Exchange by taking into account
historical stock prices as well as sentiment data gathered from social media sites and
financial news. Additionally, macro-economic indicators like gold and oil prices are also
considered to further improve the predictive accuracy. By adding outside variables like
investor mood, political news, and global economic indicators, the aim is to increase the
accuracy of stock price forecasts.
The project objectives are listed below:
● Develop an Advanced Stock Forecasting Model
● Incorporate Sentiment Analysis
● Leverage Macro-Economic Indicators
● Enhance Prediction Accuracy (as compared to traditional methods)
● Provide a Predictive Analysis Platform for Investors
● Fill a Market Gap
● Validate Model Performance

Scope:
Module 1- Historical Price Prediction using LSTM
Use the LSTM Recurrent Neural Network model to predict stock prices based on
historical trends.
1. Train the LSTM model on historical prices.
2. Output predicted prices in a Time-Series format.

Module 2- Sentiment Analysis
Perform sentiment analysis on data gathered from different media and news sources.
1. Gather sentiment data from various media and news sources.
2. Filter into buckets i.e related to a particular stock, political data,
macro-economics related etc. Identify whether it’ll have an effect on global
(market) or local (stock) scope.
3. Classify the data into positive/negative sentiment.
4. Use SVMorCNNswith Adaboost/Catboost for optimized classification.

Module 3- Time-Series Forecasting
Perform traditional Time-Series forecasting on historical stock prices using ARIMA or
Bayesian Structural Time-Series (BST).
1. Apply the ARIMA/BST for Time-Series Forecasting.
2. Output the forecasted results.

Module 4- Front-End
Develop a user-friendly front-end for the web application.
1. Use React for handling front-end related operations.
2. Add data visualization enhancements to aid users in understanding complex data
such as stock prediction graphs, sentiment analysis cues etc

Module 5- Back-End
Develop a comprehensive back-end for API and database handling.
1. Use Flask and Gunicorn for API handling.
2. Use Docker for containerization.
3. Use Nginx/Caddy to implement a reverse proxy for the website.

Module 6- Ensemble Model Architecture
Merging Sentiment Analysis, LSTM and BST (or ARIMA) Outputs through a Dense
Layer/CNN
1. Feature 1: Multi-input model architecture combining LSTM, Sentiment Analysis,
and BST (or ARIMA) outputs.

2. Feature 2: Flexible integration using either Dense layers or CNN for advanced
feature extraction
