Conventional forecasting\nmethods mostly base their projections on historical price trends. Therefore,, these\ntechniques frequently fail to take into consideration abrupt changes in the market\nenvironment and the non-linear linkages that control fluctuations in stock prices. This\nproject aims to improve upon these traditional techniques by incorporating both\ntraditional statistical techniques and modern machine learning techniques. The primary\nfocus is on improving stock price predictions by taking into account not only the\nhistorical stock prices but also sentiment analysis and macro-economic indicators. [5]\nThe PSX market is influenced by a wide range of factors such as political\ndevelopments, economic conditions and market sentiments. Traditional time-series\nforecasting methods like ARIMA often struggle to account for abrupt market changes\nand non-linear factors. This limitation is highlighted even more in PSX as it is a highly\nvolatile market that is heavily influenced by external factors. The proposed system\naddresses these challenges by incorporating state-of-the-art machine learning\ntechniques like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with traditional statistical models like\nARIMA or Bayesian Structural Time-Series (BST). Moreover, sentiment analysis from\nsocial media and news sources as well as macro-economic factors like Gold and Oil\nprices are also incorporated to increase the prediction accuracy further.\n\nPlease extract and format the following fields:\n1.

This difficulty is made much more acute in the case of the Pakistan Stock\nExchange (PSX) by the market’s susceptibility to regional political and economic\nsituations. The proposed system provides a solution to these difficulties by incorporating\nmodern machine learning techniques along with traditional statistical techniques,\nmacro-economic data and sentiment analysis to accurately predict stock prices. In\nrecent years, machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for handling complex\ndata patterns, allowing for more sophisticated and adaptable forecasting models. It is\nfeasible to extract patterns from stock market data and get deeper insights by utilizing\nthe capabilities of neural networks, such as RNN and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nmodels. These neural network models may also help identify trends that conventional\nmethods would overlook [1]. Furthermore, sentiment analysis may be included into\nstock price prediction for increased prediction accuracy. This technique analyzes the\ntone and sentiment of news articles, social media postings, and financial data to provide\nuseful context.\n\nPlease extract and format the following fields:\n1.
